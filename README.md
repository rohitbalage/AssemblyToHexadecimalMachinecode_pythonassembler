# AssemblyToHexadecimalMachinecode_pythonassembler

This project is designed  to understand the RISC architecture (MIPS) and its instruction set and assembly. Students will gain programming experience in Python.

assembler will read and parse the contents of a simple MIPS program (program.asm). The file name of program.asm is given from the command line. Each line of the program contains an MIPS instruction or a directive. A label will appear on a line by itself. Operands are comma-separated. No line is blank. No comment is allowed. There will be no white spaces between operands. All lines will begin with a tab except labels. Only decimal numbers are allowed.
